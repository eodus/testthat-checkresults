transmission *  checking whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies ... WARNING
Error: .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'transmission', details:
  call: NULL
  error: "package:methods" %in% search() is not TRUE
Execution halted

A namespace must be able to be loaded with just the base namespace
loaded: otherwise if the namespace gets loaded by a saved object, the
session will be unable to start.

Probably some imports need to be declared in the NAMESPACE file.
